# This is a JavaScript directory with basic functions

1. Example.js
   - This contains the basic knowledge about declaration and initiation of variables with the following keywords:
      - let
      - var
      - const

2. operator.js
   This file conatains the basic knowledge about operators.

   - ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
   This is used to apply mathematical instructions to values.
   These include addition(+), subtraction(-),multiplication(*), modulo(%) and division(/).

   - INCREMENT OPERATORS
   These operators increase the number of a variable by a given number. This operator uses the Addition operator(+)
     - pre-increment
       "let num3 = 5;
        let result5 = ++num3;
        let answer = num3"

        Here, num3 = 5 before increment, result5 = 6 because we are applying increment before use and answer = 6 because it is used after increment.

     - post increment
       "let num3 = 5;
        let result5 = num3++;
        let answer = num3"

        Here, num3 = 5 before increment, result5 = 5 because we are using the number value before increment and answer = 6 because it is used after increment.
