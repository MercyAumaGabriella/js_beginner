# This is a JavaScript directory with basic functions

1. Example.js
   - This contains the basic knowledge about declaration and initiation of variables with the following keywords:
      - let
      - var
      - const

2. operator.js
   This file conatains the basic knowledge about operators.

   - ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
   This is used to apply mathematical instructions to values.
   These include addition(+), subtraction(-),multiplication(*), modulo(%) and division(/).

   - INCREMENT OPERATORS
   These operators increase the number of a variable by a given number. This operator uses the Addition operator(+)
     - pre-increment
       "let num3 = 5;
        let result5 = ++num3;
        let answer = num3"

        Here, num3 = 5 before increment, result5 = 6 because we are applying the increment before use and answer = 6 because it is the value used after increment.

     - post increment
       "let num3 = 5;
        let result5 = num3++;
        let answer = num3"

        Here, num3 = 5 before increment, result5 = 5 because we are using the number value before applying the increment and answer = 6 because it is the value used after increment.

   - DECREMENT OPERATORS
   These operators decrease the number of a variable by a given number. This operator uses the Subtraction operator(+)
     - pre-decrement
       "let num5 = 5;
        let result7 = --num5;
        let answer2 = num5"

        Here, num5 = 5 before decrement, result5 = 4 because we are applying the decrement before use and answer2 = 4 because it is the value used after the decrement.

     - post increment
       "let num6 = 9;
        let result8 = num6--;
        let answer3 = num6"

        Here, num6 = 9 before decrement, result8 = 9 because we are using the number value before applying the decrement and answer3 = 8 because it is the value after decrement.
